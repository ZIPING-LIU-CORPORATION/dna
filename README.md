# Genes


These are my genes.

There's literally nothing special about them, just a plethora of pyramids.

Our genes don't make us who we are, it's how we transcend our genetic programming, that makes us a Human being - one angle of many angles of transcendence beyond our selfish (but not self-less) form of existence.
